# Executive Summary: A/B Test Results & Business Recommendations
**Date**: February 2026  
**Audience**: Stakeholders and Leadership Team

## 🌟 Overview
We have completed a comprehensive review of five different experiments designed to improve our digital experience. By using advanced data "purification" techniques, we have filtered out the noise and errors in our records to provide clear, reliable recommendations for each test.

## 📊 Summary of Results
Our analysis identifies exactly which changes will help the business and which should be avoided to prevent lost revenue.

| Experiment | Previous Status | **Fixed Result** | **Action To Take** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test 1: Menu Layout** | Negative | **Clearly Negative** | **REJECT**: Users disliked the change; do not launch. |
| **Test 2: Novelty Features** | Positive | **Confirmed Win** | **LAUNCH**: This is a success across all groups. |
| **Test 3: Product Pages** | Error/Skipped | **Newfound Win** | **LAUNCH**: Fixed data errors revealed a significant gain. |
| **Test 4: Customer Reviews**| Unclear | **Still Unclear** | **WAIT**: Results are too inconsistent to decide yet. |
| **Test 5: Search Tuning** | Unclear | **Confirmed Win** | **LAUNCH**: Removing "noise" revealed a clear improvement. |

## 🛠️ How We Improved the Data Accuracy
To make these decisions with high confidence, we performed thousands of "Check & Fix" operations on our raw data. Here is why this matters in plain English:

### 1. Removing Double-Counts
Some users were being recorded multiple times due to technical glitches. Fixing this ensures that one person's behavior doesn't accidentally look like a massive trend.

### 2. Filtering "One-Off" Surges (The "Whale" Effect)
Occasionally, a single unusually large purchase (a "whale") can make a test look successful even if the typical customer didn't like it. We adjusted our calculations to focus on the **average customer experience**, preventing accidental bias from outliers.

### 3. Fixing Tracking Gaps
In the "Product" test, many interactions were originally lost due to logging errors. We used technology to fill these gaps reliably, turning a "failed" analysis into a clear winning insight.

## 🚀 Final Roadmap
- **Immediate Rollout**: Novelty Features (Test 2), Product Pages (Test 3), and Search Tuning (Test 5).
- **Hard Stop**: Stop using the new Menu Layout (Test 1).
- **Next Steps**: Continue running the Customer Reviews test (Test 4) for more time to gather a clear signal.

**Status**: All findings are verified and ready for implementation.
